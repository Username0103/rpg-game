code ideas:
    make the player character a class, and pass that class around.
    divide each part of the code into a module
    a big data module that would contain all of the enemy data and maybe player move data

game ideas:
    have the game be on a grid, which isn't represented graphically
    procedural generation?
    saving needs to be accounted for early on
    player has magic attacks and normal attacks
    maybe make it a roguelike.

issues:
    fix keyerror in config_manager in options_menu --done--
